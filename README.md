# Alien Shooter Game 🎮

## Project Overview

Alien Shooter is a 2D arcade-style shooting game developed using **Python** and the **Pygame** library. The player controls a spaceship positioned at the bottom of the screen and must shoot incoming alien enemies before they reach the player. The game focuses on simple controls, real-time interaction, and classic arcade gameplay.

## Features

* Player-controlled spaceship movement using keyboard keys
* Bullet firing mechanism to destroy enemies
* Multiple alien enemies with movement patterns
* Collision detection between bullets and enemies
* Real-time score tracking
* Sound effects and background music
* Game over condition when enemies reach the player

## Controls

* **Left Arrow Key** – Move spaceship left
* **Right Arrow Key** – Move spaceship right
* **Space Bar** – Fire bullets

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pygame library

## Game Flow

1. Game initializes by loading assets, sounds, and variables
2. Player controls the spaceship to shoot enemies
3. Enemies move across and down the screen
4. Score increases when enemies are destroyed
5. Game ends when enemies reach the player’s level

## How to Run the Game

1. Install Python on your system
2. Install Pygame using `pip install pygame`
3. Place all image and sound files in the same directory as the code
4. Run the Python file to start the game

## Conclusion

Alien Shooter is a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates core game development concepts such as event handling, animation, collision detection, and sound integration using Pygame. It serves as a strong foundation for learning Python-based game development.
